Git is a Distributed Version Control System whcih is used to create multiple versions of a projects and managed small and large projects with a team.

Version Control System:

1 - Local VCS.
2 - Centralized VCS.
3 - Distributed version control system.

Commands:

git
This shows all possible commands of github

pwd(present work directory)
This shows the current directory

git config user.name = "Ali Hamza"
OR
$ git config --global user.name "Ali Hamza"
This configure user Name


$ git config --global user.email "alihamza.aimviz99@gmail.com"

$ git config user.email "alihamza.aimviz99@gmail.com"

This Coonfigure Email

git init
This command create current directory a Git Directory

git status
This Command Show every file change status

Three Stage Archietecture:
Working directory
Staging Area
Git Directory (Repositry)

This is use for temporary exempt a file which user doesn't want to update in next commit.
this file stored in temporary state name "staging".

Initialize First Git Project:
Create a project in a folder and open this directory on terminal

git init(Create git repositry)

git add --a (--a this use for place files in staging area)

git commit -m "Portal_APX Created" (This make a commit, "-m" use for message )

git log (shows command shows all commit details)

Clone a repositry from Github:

Create a Folder in your local PC where you want to place the project.

Open a project you want to clone on github
Click on Code Button
in Close section (HTTP)
copy the URL

Open folder in terminal on local PC:
run command:
git clone paste project url here

Git Ingone:
If you don't want to upload any file in a repositry
Create a file and named it ".gitignore" it is aslo a extension.

open .gitignore file code Editor
just type name of file
error.log

File Status Life Cycle in GIT:
There are 4 phases:

Untracked
Unmodified
Modified
Staged

You created a directory in your PC
when you run "git init" git takes control of this directory.

UNTRACKED:
Now you run "git status" git show you untracked files.

UNMODIFIED:
When you run "git add" it add files to staging area and show it unmodified state.

UNMODIFIED:
When you edit any file and run "git status" Now this shows unmodified files.

STAGED:
When we commit the code using "git commit" command it is in staged state.

Difference between Commit, Staging Area and Working Directory:

git diff --staged (Compare working directory to staged data)

git diff ( Comapre working directory to last commit)
